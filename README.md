# FluidMechMathematica

Interactive plumbing network designer project. Made in WKU's CS 371 class (Advanced Computational Problem Solving)

I included pdfs of the code above, because .nb files require Mathematica to view.

For more information, please view the Final Report pdf in the folder.
It has detailed instructions for running the code (use Mathematica 11!), a research section, and a section on data structures used.
